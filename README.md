# CycleGAN-SD
The implementation of CycleGAN-SD for zero-shot fault diagnosis (Ongoing update)

# Dataset
This example is based on the Tennessee-Eastman Process (TEP)  dataset.

# Requirements 
```
python = 3.9.20
torch version: 2.4.0
pandas = 1.3.5
tiktoken version: 0.7.0
scikit-learn = 1.0.2                                                                                                     `
```
The codes was tested with pytorch 2.4.0, CUDA driver 12.7, CUDA toolkit 11.8, Ubuntu 22.04.
